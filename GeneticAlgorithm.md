# Genetic Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm (GA, for short) is a type of optimization algorithm which aims to mimic the evolutionary behavior of animal species in order to find the optimum of a given function.

Usually they are divided in 5 steps:
1. **Evaluation**: Each solution is evaluated.
2. **Selection**: The best solutions are selected to reproduce, or rather the worst solutions are not included/considered during the reproduction.
3. **Crossover/Reproduction**: The best solutions are randomly combined to create new solutions and fill the next generation.
4. **Mutation**: The new solutions are randomly modified to introduce variety in the population.
