# Firefly + BFGS Optimization with CPU & GPU Acceleration

This project implements a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm that combines the Firefly Algorithm (FA) with the BFGS (quasi-Newton method) for high-precision refinement

x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + Î²â‚€ * exp(-Î³ * r_ijÂ²) * (x_j(t) - x_i(t)) + Î± * rand()
Where:

Î²â‚€ = base attractiveness,

Î³ = light absorption coefficient,

r_ij = distance between fireflies i and j,

Î± = randomness factor,

rand() = random vector âˆˆ [-0.5, 0.5].

BFGS refines the best solution found by FA using a gradient-based update:
x_{k+1} = x_k - H_k * âˆ‡f(x_k)

Where:

H_k = approximation of the inverse Hessian,

âˆ‡f(x_k) = gradient at point x_k.


ðŸ”§ CMake Build
To build with CUDA support (dafault is OFF):
