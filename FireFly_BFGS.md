# Firefly + BFGS Optimization with CPU & GPU Acceleration

This project implements a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm that combines the Firefly Algorithm (FA) with the BFGS (quasi-Newton method) for high-precision refinement

#### Firefly Algorithm Update Rule
```
x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + Î²â‚€ * exp(-Î³ * r_ijÂ²) * (x_j(t) - x_i(t)) + Î± * rand()
```

Where:
- `Î²â‚€`: base attractiveness  
- `Î³`: light absorption coefficient  
- `r_ij`: Euclidean distance between fireflies `i` and `j`  
- `Î±`: randomness factor  
- `rand()`: random vector in [-0.5, 0.5]

BFGS refines the best solution found by FA using a gradient-based update:

```
x_{k+1} = x_k - H_k * âˆ‡f(x_k)
```

Where:
- `H_k`: approximation of the inverse Hessian  
- `âˆ‡f(x_k)`: gradient at point `x_k`
