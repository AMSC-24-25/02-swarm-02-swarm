	\section{Genetic Algorithm}
	A Genetic Algorithm (GA, for short) is a type of derivative-free optimization algorithm which aims to mimic the evolutionary behavior of animal species in order to find the optimum of a given function.
	In the GA jargon, a \textbf{creature} is a certain solution (i.e. a point in the \textit{n}-dimensional search space) while the \textbf{population} is the collection of all solutions currently handled by the algorithm. Also, to further explain the analogy, it is really common to see Genetic Algorithm descriptions using the term \textbf{generation} to indicate iterations and \textbf{offspring} to indicate the population for the next generation.
	
	A Genetic Algorithm, at a high level, is divided in 4 steps, to be repeated as many times as needed:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Evaluation}: Each creature/solution is evaluated and assigned a \textbf{fitness score}.

		\item \textbf{Selection}: Based on the results of the evaluation phase, a process is applied to either select the "best" creatures (the ones with better results) or to discard the "worst" creatures. This process emulates the natural selection applied from a certain environment to the animal species which live in it.
		
		\item \textbf{Crossover/Reproduction}: During this phase, the selected creatures are randomly combined to create new offspring (new solutions) to fill the next generation.

		\item \textbf{Mutation}: The solutions in the new generation are randomly modified to introduce variety in the population.
	\end{enumerate}

	A Genetic Algorithm needs a pair of parameters to control its behavior:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{survival rate}: a coefficient between 0 and 1 representing the relative amount of creatures surviving from a generation to the next one.
		\item The \textbf{mutation rate}: a coefficient between 0 and 1 representing the probability of a mutation appearing in a creature.
	\end{itemize}

	These two parameters help to control the algorithm's behavior and to balance it between exploration and convergence.
	A low survival rate means that a lot of solutions are discarded at each generation and, therefore, the offspring is generated from a small pool of creatures resulting in a fast convergence towards an optimum.
	A high mutation rate, on the other hand, makes the algorithm more similar to a random search since many of the creatures of each generation are 

	\section{Analysis}
	In our implementation of the GA, we decided to use the selection technique often referred to as \textbf{elitism} which is really straightforward: if we say that $n$ is the size of the population and $s$ is the survival rate, this technique sorts all the creatures based on their fitness score and discards all the worst $n \cdot (1 - s)$ creatures.

	\subsection{Evaluation}
	The evaluation phase requires to compute the value of the objective/fitness function for each creature in the population. We can assume that the evaluation of the objective function on a given creature is independent from all the other creatures in the population so this phase is embarrassingly parallel.
	We can also optimize this phase by avoiding to re-compute the fitness for creatures which did not change since the last generation.
